<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About Infinite Market

There are many ways to get plugins for Infinite Yield, however, Infinite Market makes it easier, and faster. With a click of a button, you'll already have a plugin installed and imported into Infinite Yield automatically.

Here's why you should use Infinite Market:
* Installing plugins has never been easier. You can save a lot of time using Infinite Market.
* Plugins are added and stored in the cloud, meaning it easy for us to add more plugins to the catalog.
* Infinite Market is extremly simple to use.
